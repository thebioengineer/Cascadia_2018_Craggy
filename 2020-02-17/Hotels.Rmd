```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)

tt <- tt_load(2020, week = 7)
tt

```

```{r cars}

tt$hotels %>% 
  select(
    month = arrival_date_month, 
    day   = arrival_date_day_of_month, 
    year  = arrival_date_year,
    adr, 
    lead_time
  )

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
